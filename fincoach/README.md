# FinCoach: Reasoning-Based Investment Advisor

## Overview
FinCoach is a conversational AI agent that provides personalized investment advice to retail investors. Unlike simple retrieval bots, FinCoach reasons through your financial context, asks clarifying questions, and explains its recommendations step by step.

## Features
- Asks follow-up questions to gather your financial context
- Uses DeepSeek and LangGraph for reasoning and chain-of-thought explanations
- Returns a user profile and tailored investment suggestions
- Provides a Streamlit UI for easy interaction

## Example Conversation
```
User: Should I invest in stocks?
Agent: How old are you? What's your income & savings goal?
User: I'm 45, earning 25L, saving for retirement in 15 years.
Agent:
  Reasoning: Mid-age, decent income, long-term horizon â†’ moderate risk
  Advice: Consider hybrid mutual funds or blue-chip ETFs.
```
